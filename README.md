Multi Tester :-
 This latest device is called "Multi Tester". receiver, router chargers, current lines can be 
checked by this device. Apart from this, this device can perform several other functions.
 (01) The Multi Tester device has given the opportunity to test 05 cables. Accordingly, it is 
possible to check the following cables.
• RJ9
• RJ11
• RJ45
• HDMI
• USB
 Accordingly, to check the RJ9 cable with this device, the cable must be connected to 
the RJ9 checking point. Then select the RJ9 cable from among the cables that appear on the device's 
display. Up, Down, Select buttons on the device are helpful for that. After selecting the cable, "Cable: 
Working" will appear on the display. In addition, it appears that the LED bulbs present in the device are 
connected. Accordingly, it can be identified that the RJ9 cable is in working condition.
 After that, to test the RJ45 cable, one side of the cable should be connected to the multi 
tester and the other side to the device. Then the RJ45 cable should be selected with the multi tester. 
Accordingly, if "cable : working" appears on the display, it can be identified that it is in working 
condition, but if the cable is not working, it will be shown as "cable : not working" on the display.
 (02) The receiver can also be tested by this. The RJ9 cable should be connected to the receiver 
and the other side should be connected to the 4G port of the multi tester device. (because the receiver is 
4G) after connecting, turn on the nearby switch. If a sound is emitted by the receiver, it can be confirmed 
that the speaker is working. After speaking to the mic to test the mic, if the LED bulb near the 4G port of 
the multi tester device lights up, it can be recognized that the mic is also active.
 (03) Router charger can also be checked by this device. This is also used to measure the voltage 
of the router, and after connecting the cable of the router to the multi tester device, the voltage of the 
charger will be displayed.
 (04) Since this device works with a battery backup, it is possible to configure the router when 
there is a power cut. Also, this device is made to provide light by the LED bulb in the upper part, so it is 
possible to use this device even in the dark.
 (05) In addition to this, it is possible to check the current line during construction. By connecting 
the cable of the device to this multi tester device and moving the device along the wall, the bulb will light 
up when there is a current line on that wall. Accordingly, it helps to deal with the related activities without 
disturbing the electricity supply.
Accordingly, with this device, it is possible to check the cable, check the router charger, check the 
receiver, check the voltage of the router charger, and in emergency situations, it is possible to configure 
the router, so this multi tester device can be introduced as a very important device. It is also important 
that the LED bulb is installed so that this device can be used even in the dark. In the communication 
sector, this device is useful as a very important device and it is very important to be able to use it easily 
as well as to have many features.
